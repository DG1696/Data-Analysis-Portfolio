- Highlight the top and bottom performing stores based on sales.
- Provide a detailed breakdown of sales by departments (e.g., Health & Beauty, Home Decor).
- Enable year-over-year comparison of sales (LY vs. CY).
- Monitor department-specific sales trends to align strategies with demand patterns.

Key Features
Performance Metrics:
- Total Sales, Profit, Margin %, and other key metrics are prominently displayed for quick reference.
- Stores are ranked by total sales, allowing stakeholders to identify the best and worst performers at a glance.

Impact & Benefits :
- The transition from manual Excel tracking to an automated Power BI solution significantly reduced the risk of errors in stock reporting. The number of data entry errors dropped by 40%, leading to more accurate 
  inventory data.
- The historical data view provided insights into stock movement trends, helping stakeholders forecast demand more accurately. This resulted in a 15% decrease in stock wastage due to better alignment between 
  stock levels and actual demand.
