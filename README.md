Project No 1 -Christmas Sales Performance Dashboard 
Project Overview:
This Power BI dashboard was developed to provide insights into Christmas sales performance for a retail chain. It enables stakeholders to easily identify top-performing and underperforming stores, compare sales across departments, and evaluate overall business performance during the festive season. The raw dataset contained over 579 million rows, which required extensive filtering to focus on Christmas-specific sales data. The data was cleaned, structured, and validated to ensure accuracy and relevance before visualization.

Objectives:
- Rank stores by total sales within specific regions.
- Highlight the top and bottom performing stores based on sales.
- Provide a detailed breakdown of sales by departments (e.g., Health & Beauty, Home Decor).
- Enable year-over-year comparison of sales (LY vs. CY).
- Monitor department-specific sales trends to align strategies with demand patterns.

Key Features
Performance Metrics:
- Total Sales, Profit, Margin %, and other key metrics are prominently displayed for quick reference.
- Stores are ranked by total sales, allowing stakeholders to identify the best and worst performers at a glance.

Tools & Techniques
Power BI: Used for dashboard creation with dynamic visualizations and DAX for advanced calculations.
MS SQL Server Management Studio: Used for extraction and manipulation.
